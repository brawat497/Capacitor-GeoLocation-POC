    <!--
        The icon to use for the background notification. Note the absence of a
        leading "@". It defaults to "mipmap/ic_launcher", the app's launch icon.

        If a raster image is used to generate the icon (as opposed to a vector
        image), it must have a transparent background. To make sure your image
        is compatible, select "Notification Icons" as the Icon Type when
        creating the image asset in Android Studio.

        An incompatible image asset will cause the notification to misbehave in
        a few telling ways, even if the icon appears correctly:

          - The notification may be dismissable by the user when it should not
            be.
          - Tapping the notification may open the settings, not the app.
          - The notification text may be incorrect.
